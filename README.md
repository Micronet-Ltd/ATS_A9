# ATS - Telematics Service

This is the ATS code repo for the OBC5 and SmarTab. Refer to ATS legacy for the ATS code for the A317. 

These projects require the correct system signing keys. Sample files are included for you to copy and edit so they point to the correct keys.

Copy and edit these files in project root directory:

	"obc5keys.properties.sample" to "obc5keys.properties"

The configuration.xml file goes to `/storage/sdcard0/ATS` for the OBC5. It will be renamed to 'configuration.xml.bak' when it is read in.

Documentation can be found [here](https://micronet1023744.sharepoint.com/RD/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewpath=%2FRD%2FForms%2FAllItems%2Easpx&id=%2FRD%2FATS).

Also refer to the repo wiki for other information about the workflow of the app.
